You must be living under a rock if you haven’t heard of the doomsday scenarios that worry the likes of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak and Stephen Hawking. Many of them got
inspired by Nick Bostrom’s book Superintelligence.

There are important counterarguments such as an [article](http://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm) that went viral on some of the biggest tech sites such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

From Wikipedia:

> Bias is an inclination or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective, often accompanied by a refusal to consider the possible merits of alternative points of view.
> In order to have a meaningful discussion we need to minimize bias. This is exceedingly difficult since bias is highly dependent on fear.

Let’s split the two groups that participate in the argument. I will call people that do not think AI poses a risk “The Jamaicans” and the ones with directly opposite opinion “The Annihilists”.

A very important point is that both groups contain highly intelligent people capable of producing extreme quality arguments that would put to the ground most conversations with laymen. They can write articles in newspapers and talk to prominent journalists and have sufficient media exposure.

> We are talking about the same people that made the machines that you use to read this article, to communicate with your child and to transport yourself. Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak kick started the modern computer era.

I don’t know how big your ego is but mine is not so big as to discard their warnings.

But I argue here that both sides have a bias. The Jamaicans are suffering from “Status Quo Bias” which is a preference for the current state of affairs. The Jamaicans subtly tilt their perception to accommodate a future that is not drastically different from what they experience now.

On the other side, The Annihilists are suffering from excessive fear categorized as “Emotional Bias” that the human race will be extinct by superintelligence.

_You can have the same groups arguing about a possible alien encounter too._

Now let’s run some possible scenarios here:

Boring scenario:

The Jamaicans were right. Super intelligence is impossible to attain or when it is achieved it helps us augment humanity and solve a lot of problems.

The negative effects of “The Annihilists” in this scenario:

- Progress is slowed down by introducing multiple checks, blocking and scrutinizing research.
- Society has more negative stress vibes circulating

Doomsday scenario:

Being a society based on science, which hypothesis is more important to test? A) The Jamaicans are wrong or B) The Annihilists are wrong.

**We can make our own destiny.**
