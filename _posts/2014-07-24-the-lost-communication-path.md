So I had a conversation with a friend yesterday, a long time Internet enthusiast himself. The type that used to log in with 1200 bps modems like myself. The good times. It was much more about communication then, there was this inherent pleasure to be able to talk to people using a machine, without talking actually. It was like discovering this new world that was mysterious and sexy.

After the BBS came IRC. WOW. People from all over the world? Seriously I can talk to someone from Uruguay real-time?

I spent whole nights (during the day I was at school;sleeping) having meaningless or not so much conversations with people that I didn’t know. I was also a frequent visitor at a local channel of my country but I was fascinated by other things mostly. You could be in a channel that hosted the most famous hackers, you could actually talk to them and maybe get an answer. Superstars.

Fast forward, this thing simply doesn’t exist anymore. Anonymous chat equals usually sex,perverts or drug trafficking. Freenode? Yeah,this a developer tool.

Fuck this. I want to talk with an unknown Chinese artist and maybe get invited to his place for a dinner sometime.

Morning nostalgia.
