Bitcoin is a highly volatile and deflationary currency that was used primarily for donations and small purchases (as well as drug/gun trading but that’s another issue). This has created a funny chain of events where for example someone -please comment here if it is you 🙂 – bought a pizza worth 10,000btc somewhere in 2010. Well yeah, this guy has probably a ton of btc now to feel rich, but he still paid something like \$9m for a pizza; probably without truffle.

But this is something of no consequence. What matters in this story is that people that traditionally don’t get huge amounts of money are millionaires and probably billionaires. Few people realize this but owning just 1k BTCis like owning a million with today’s prices. But this is peanuts, this is what a lot of people have right now. We are talking about IT enthusiasts, kids, guys in their 50s that played with radio shacks in their youth and then settled for a low-paying job as a hardware assistant in Wall Mart. Now it is their time. It resembles an anarchy-style reallocation of resources where there is no plan like in Communism or anarchy itself (yes there is order in anarchy too). Even raw and totally liberal capitalism is not randomly reallocating such big amounts of money. The “natural” selection is usually based on risk, education, opportunity, skills and luck. This time all these played a small role, the protagonist was luck in the set of individuals that knew something about technology and were lucky enough to stumble on an article or a forum thread.

> AS EXCITING AND UNPREDICTABLE THIS MAY BE, IT IS YET OF NO GREAT SIGNIFICANCE. WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND MAY HAVE INTERESTING(?) IMPLICATIONS IS THAT GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND NOT INDIVIDUALS HAVE AMASSED SUCH A GREAT WEALTH THAT WILL HELP FUND THEIR CAUSE.

Anonymous for example ,the famous activist/hacking group, has a big amount of BTC which obviously is impossible to calculate , probably a mixture of donations and some hacking. (I remind you of the 250k BTC theft that was the main topic of discussion about a year ago).
Chinese and Russian hacking groups have long been hacking into exchange websites and circulating viruses that steal bitcoins from unsuspected pc users, or using botnets to mine them.
Wikileaks is also a good example of an organization that has received a big amount of donations.

This can have tremendous implications in our lives. I do not know if it will be in a positive or negative way. It just will.Sure,the mafia or government organizations were supporting hacking groups but I highly doubt they were paying them in millions per month.

This means a lot to kids that were just having a hobby with a dream to change the world and then sometime left it for studying or participate in open source projects, finally finding their way in some developer job. Now they can do this for the rest of their lives. There is no pressure.

If you look at other activist groups, now they have real power to do things that will change the world in the direction they want. They can invest in research, in buying rare and high-tech equipment and in general they can try to do some things they never imagined of.

One thing is for sure, there can be no predictions. Maybe its more fun this way, maybe the world economy needed a wake up call.
