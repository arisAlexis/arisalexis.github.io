I was never really an arts person. I was very much into logic and didn’t really understand how people could be so interested in it. When I was a young child, I remember I asked my dad “how come all songs talk about love?” and he replied “because that’s all there is”. This stuck with me.

Growing up as a geek that writes code as a profession I started reading Kurzweil’s essays and started really thinking about what would be the distinction between an intelligent machine that can perform most of the tasks humans can more efficiently and you know, us humans. I found this small sentence from my dad that I have been carrying in some deep brain database cell to fit perfectly with my quest for answers. You see, it’s always good to listen to enlightened people from our generation like Elon or Nick but you really have to internalize it and make this perception yours. It doesn’t work if you just read facts and convincing arguments, at least with me that is.

Slowly this idea started creeping into my mind that I have been missing out on some very important aspect of life. The idea that art is an expression of emotions (from which love is the greatest one) and this is the only thing that can distinguish us from an intelligent machine. Many people would laugh and say “sure, you just discovered America” and of course “do androids dream of electric sheep” is a pretty famous book dealing with the subject but still, I am convinced that many people are thinking like my old self.

Deep into philosophy, one can argue about what is an emotion and how it is defined and that machines could also feel emotions. I am of the opinion that emotions are created from the unique DNA sequence of each individual that is never the same and primarily influenced by our memories and current environment (in the same way that we are our memories) and this is extremely difficult to replicate. You can’t make a machine that has memories of it being human unless you recreate all these conditions and raise this machine as a human in a human body by humans for 20+ years. Otherwise it would be a simulation but that would need to use other machines acting as humans so you can never really recreate the same thing.

Fast forward some years the world will run on Universal Income except for some very creative professions that would be paid very well. People will have so much free time in their hands because our AI friends will take care of feeding us with all the ingredients they are cultivating and then applying machine learning to make the best recipes humans crave and all of these running on renewable energy from self-replicating robots. So what’s left for us?

Art. Emotions. Creation.

Until we merge with the machines.
