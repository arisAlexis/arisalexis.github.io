So let’s get philosophical. How many times did you think that life is hard and others have the best of it? Lady luck plays a significant role in our lives and that is good because otherwise life would be extremely boring.
Chess is a game where there are perfect moves and no luck. Have you seen people obsessed with chess on a large scale? Cool chess tournaments with cheering crowd and twitch.tv streams?

## The Poker Mindset

is probably the best book I have ever read on poker. Not only it emphasizes the obvious work hard play hard mentality but also it gives the perspective on how to approach probabilities and +EV decisions. Only the more awoken spirits can grasp the concept of EV in every day life. I was watching a documentary about Mossad and spy ops the other day when the journalist asked the director about a certain positive outcome and the decision behind it when he gave a super important insight: “just because the outcome was positive doesn’t mean that the decision was the correct one”. This is extremely difficult to realize in everyday life where if you take a decision to buy a used car for a certain price against what all your friends say and the car breaks down the next day, the decision was apparently wrong.

Not being results orientated in life is much harder than doing it in poker.

## Quits

Ever since I started studying poker in more depth and experiencing for years all the emotions and life lessons that gives you I think there is a very direct comparison between especially a poker tournament and life. More so than cash games because even if bad luck has stricken you hard you never quit in a tournament because there is no money to save. You are all in from the start and that’s how life works too. Can’t call quits though, ever. That’s the most -EV move you can ever make.

## Capitalism

Poker is the ultimate form of capitalism where there is obviously luck involved but on average the more skilled people that put themselves in the right circumstances are better off. One thing is for sure, if you take silly risks with negative expectations for a long time in poker, even your infinite bankroll will dry up. The famous Lady Marmalade account on Pokerstars kept the money flow for many years but it finally came to an end.

There has been a lot of discussion and articles about inequality and how wealth distribution doesn’t follow a Gaussian curve like intelligence and that skills are disproportionately present in the parameters of success. It’s true that life more resembles a Power Law distribution such as the lower one. But that cannot ever mean that since there is a lot of luck involved then honing other skills or playing the best game that you can are not important. That should be obvious to a poker player. In fact, they are the only things that you can do because your hand is dealt and even if its 72o you need to hold it until the hand is over.

## Winning

The most striking similarities in the approach to life and poker are meticulous planning and controlled aggression. You need to study much, chose your battleground, don’t take silly risks but do take risks because otherwise you can’t win. Now what does win mean in this context? Well that is everyone needs to think deep and hard and maybe change goals from time to time.
