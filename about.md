After buying my first 2400 modem back in 1995 the world changed for me. I consider myself a true internet native who followed his life path onto becoming a software developer. I have lived in Thessaloniki and Amsterdam and worked for companies including my own ranging from startups to government organizations (EU Commission).

## Early Computer days

My first computer was a Hyundai 80286 which I got because I was jealous of a friend of mine that I would go each afternoon after school and play F-117 on a green screen. I had a color VGA display and felt very superior. At around that time I got introduced to BASIC which I honestly didn't like. I later fell in love with the power of Pascal. When the internet boomed I used to hack with friends the local BBS and many other sites that I am too afraid of admitting. After playing around with C I discovered PHP and from then on I never stopped making web applications of various kinds.

## Hobbies

I have tried a big variety of hobbies ranging from snowboarding, skateboarding, electronic music production, poker (which was almost a full time job at some point), table tennis (regional junior champion). Hands down the one that got me most hooked was skateboarding, I would do it for days without stopping only to eat a bit and sleep. I got the same fascination with poker with all its psychology, math and strategy combination.

Current hobbies include reading classics that I missed as a youngster & tennis. Lately I am as enthusiastic about buying that modem as with buying a VR headset. This is again a game changer.

## Music

At first I listed to a lot of electronic music of the jungle and breakbeat type but then I transitioned to more techno and electro. There was good clubbing in my 20s in my home town.
Although I do not consider myself talented and the main reason for having stopped producing music (although I know think that is not reason enough to stop a hobby), I did manage to get 3 tracks published on beatport from different record labels. You can find them [here](https://www.beatport.com/artist/aris-in-code/95703).
Another 2 unpublished are lying on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/fake-rebel).

## The way forward

As I am growing older I find myself more and more interested about ecology, politics and longevity. I am trying to help through startups,side projects & volunteering.
You can contact me about any innovative & crazy idea, I love chatting about them. You can reach out to me at **aris.alexis.gia at gmail.com**.
